- This project aims to enhance code security by identifying vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices. The project is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of code security. You can contribute to any of the modules by following the links below. If you have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us on the provided platforms.

## `Modules`

1. [Server - Client Side](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m1) [‚úÖ done üéØ]

   This module focuses on the server-client architecture and implements secure coding practices for both sides.

2. [Types of Authentication](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m2)

   In this module, different types of authentication mechanisms are explored, emphasizing secure implementations.

3. [Password Hashes and Storage](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m3)

   The module covers various methods for securely hashing and storing passwords, ensuring their confidentiality.

4. [Input Sanitization (WAF)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m4) [üìàüßë‚Äçüíª in progress]

   This module focuses on input sanitization techniques, particularly implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent common vulnerabilities.

5. [Impact Mitigation (Isolation)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m5)

   In this module, strategies for mitigating the impact of security breaches, particularly through isolation techniques, are explored.

6. [Rate Limiting (On Application)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m6)

   The module addresses the importance of rate limiting and implements techniques to prevent abuse and ensure application stability.

7. [Fail2Ban (On System - Blue Teaming)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m7)

   This module focuses on using Fail2Ban, a popular intrusion prevention tool, to enhance system security from a blue teaming perspective.

8. [Authorization (Secure Permission Levels)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m8)

   In this module, secure authorization mechanisms and permission levels are implemented to ensure proper access control.

9. [Secure Work Practices (e.g., .env on Server)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m9)

   The module covers secure work practices, such as properly handling sensitive information like environment variables (.env) on the server.

10. [Secure and Reliable Communication](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m10)

    This module focuses on establishing secure and reliable communication channels, implementing encryption and other relevant techniques.
